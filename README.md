# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to exploring the process of requirement analysis in software development.  
It provides documentation, examples, and techniques used to gather, analyze, and manage software requirements effectively during the early stages of the software development life cycle.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or altered software product. It serves as a foundational step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), where clear, comprehensive, and agreed-upon requirements are established before any actual development begins.

Requirement Analysis typically involves:
- Communicating with stakeholders to understand their needs
- Analyzing business goals and constraints
- Documenting functional and non-functional requirements
- Validating requirements for clarity and feasibility

### Importance in the SDLC:

1. **Clarity and Direction:** Requirement Analysis provides a clear understanding of what the software should achieve, which guides the development team throughout the project.
2. **Improved Planning:** Accura
